## 1. Project Title
 E-Commerce Product Insights: Analysis of Reviews, Ratings, and Revenue Potential

## 2. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing product data from an e-commerce platform to uncover insights that can improve pricing strategies, product visibility, and customer engagement. The analysis explores patterns in discounts, ratings, reviews, and revenue potential across different product categories.

The ultimate goal is to derive actionable insights that will help the business optimize product offerings and drive revenue growth.

## 3. Data Source
The data was sourced from internal e-commerce product databases of Amazon through the Incubator hub tutor and includes structured datasets covering:

Average discount percentages per category

Product ratings and review counts

Category-wise revenue potential

Product distribution by price and category

Each dataset is provided in a separate sheet in the Excel file named:

Avg Disc percentage by Category

Top 5 Products Rating + Review

Total Revenue Potential by Category

Number of Products per Category

Distribution of Product Ratings, etc.

## 4. Tools Used
The following tools were used during the analysis:

Microsoft Excel: For data storage, organization, and initial review

Github: For Project Reporting

## 5. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Each sheet was inspected for:

Missing values (which were minimal or non-existent)

Consistent category naming

Removal of duplicate entries

Standardization of numeric fields (e.g., converting strings to floats where needed)

## 6. Exploratory Data Analysis
### a. Discount Insights
From the Avg Disc percentage by Category and Categories with Highest Discount, we observed:

Some categories consistently receive higher discounts, which may drive volume but reduce per-unit profitability.

Strategic discounting is key: categories with mid-range discounts often had better review volume and conversion rates.

### b. Top Rated Products
The Top 5 Products Rating + Review sheet highlights high-performing products. Key observations:

Products with both high ratings and large review counts are excellent candidates for promotion.

High rating volume correlates with high visibility and user trust.

### c. Revenue Potential by Category
From the Total Revenue Potential by Category:

A few categories drive a large share of potential revenue.

These should be prioritized in terms of marketing spend and inventory stocking.

### d. Product Distribution
The Number of Products per Category and Unique Products per Price Range sheets show how diversified the inventory is.

Some categories are oversaturated while others are underrepresented.

### e. Review Distribution
The Total Number of Reviews per Category shows that certain categories (e.g., electronics or fashion) receive much higher user engagement.

Price values and percentage discounts were verified to ensure accurate numeric formatting, and column headers were cleaned for uniformity.

## Project Summary and Recommendations to Stakeholders
The project provided valuable insights into product performance across various e-commerce categories by analyzing discounts, customer ratings, reviews, and revenue projections. It has:

*Highlighted key revenue-driving categories that should be prioritized for growth.*

*Identified high-performing products that can be used for promotional campaigns.*

*Exposed discounting trends and their effect on engagement and profitability.*

*Revealed gaps in product and review distribution, enabling better inventory and customer engagement strategies.*

These insights empower the business to make data-driven decisions that improve profitability, optimize inventory, and increase customer satisfaction.

### Strategic Advice for Decision Makers
#### Prioritize High-Revenue Categories
Focus marketing, inventory, and pricing strategies on the top 3â€“5 categories with the highest revenue potential.

#### Leverage Top Rated Products
Use highly rated and frequently reviewed products in advertising, email campaigns, and homepage placements to build trust and drive conversions.

#### Optimize Discount Strategy
Avoid blanket discounting. Use targeted discounts in mid-performing categories where small price incentives can lead to large sales increases.

#### Fill Product Gaps in Low-Engagement Categories
Expand product range or improve visibility in underrepresented categories with potential based on review trends.

#### Enhance Customer Feedback Mechanisms
Encourage reviews and ratings through post-purchase follow-ups, especially in categories with low engagement but high sales volume.
